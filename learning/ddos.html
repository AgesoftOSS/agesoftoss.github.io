    <p class="learninghead2">What is a DDOS?</p>
    <p class="learningtext">A DDOS ("Distributed Denial of Service") is a malicious attack to disrupt the normal functioning of a computer network, service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from multiple devices. DDoS attacks are often used to make websites and services inaccessible, particularly those relying on wrongly protected or slow server hardware.</p>
    <p class="learninghead3">How does it work?</p>
    <p class="learningtext">To understand how a DDoS attack operates, consider the typical process of accessing an internet website. Visitors send requests to the website's server, which then responds. In the case of a DDoS attack, the server becomes the victim of a flood of requests, sometimes reaching millions per second. This incoming traffic overwhelms the server's capacity to respond, ultimately causing the service to become unavailable to legitimate users.</p>
    <p class="learninghead3">How to Identify a DDoS Attack?</p>
    <p class="learningtext"><b>Server Performance Degradation:</b> If your website or online services experience a sudden slowdown or become inaccessible, it could indicate a DDoS attack is in progress.</p>
    <p class="learninghead3">How to Protect Yourself from a DDoS Attack:</p>
    <p class="learningtext"><b>Firewalls and IDS/IPS:</b> For a proactive defense against DDoS attacks, it's wise to make use of firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). These security tools can help identify and block suspicious traffic before it reaches your network, offering an extra line of defense against DDoS threats.</p>
